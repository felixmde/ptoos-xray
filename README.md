# poos-xray

Script that annotates the Pokemon: the Origin of the Species e-book with links
to descriptions and pictures of the Pokemon within the e-book itself. 

It works with the epub that you can download from [Daystar Eld's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/daystareld/).

```shell
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python poos-xray "DaystarEld - Pokemon The Origin of Species.epub"
```
